# VHDL-4x1MUX
The VHDL code implements a 4x1 multiplexer (MUX), selecting one of four input signals based on the two select lines and producing a single output. My code implements a MUX with a 4-bit vector in VHDL called Input, and it has a 2-bit vector for Select Lines and 1 Output signal. A 4x1 multiplexer (MUX) is a digital circuit that selects one of four input signals and directs it to the output based on the combination of select inputs. Here's a general description of a 4x1 MUX:

Functionality:

A 4x1 multiplexer has four input lines (usually labeled as A, B, C, and D), one output line (often labeled as Y), and two select lines (traditionally marked as S0 and S1). The multiplexer selects one of the four input signals (A, B, C, or D) based on the binary values of the select lines S0 and S1. The output Y reflects the selected input signal. The number "4x1" indicates that the multiplexer has four inputs and one output.

Behavior:
The binary values of the select lines S0 and S1 determine the behavior of a 4x1 multiplexer. The selected input signal is directly forwarded to the output line Output. The multiplexer can be seen as a data selector, choosing one of the inputs to propagate to the output based on the select lines.

Applications:
4x1 multiplexers are widely used in digital systems for various purposes, such as data routing, signal switching, and data selection. They are commonly combined with other logic gates and components to implement complex functions and operations.

Characteristics:
A 4x1 multiplexer has four input lines, one output line, and two select lines. It typically operates with binary select inputs, allowing four different combinations. The output reflects the selected input signal, providing data routing and processing flexibility.
